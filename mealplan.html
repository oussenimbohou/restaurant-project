      <strong><h4>Breakfast</h4></strong>
      <p>
        Breakfast is the first meal of a day, most often eaten in the early morning before undertaking the day's work.
        Among English speakers, "breakfast" can be used to refer to this meal or to refer to a meal composed of traditional
        breakfast foods (such as eggs, porridge and sausage) served at any time of day.
        The word literally refers to breaking the fasting period of the prior night.

      <strong><h4>Lunch</h4></strong>
      <p>
        Lunch, the abbreviation for luncheon, is a light meal typically eaten at midday.
        The origin of the words lunch and luncheon relate to a small snack originally eaten
        at any time of the day or night. During the 20th century the meaning gradually narrowed
        to a small or mid-sized meal eaten at midday. Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day
        after breakfast.

      <strong><h4>Dinner</h4></strong>
      <p>
        Dinner usually refers to the most significant and important meal of the day,
        which can be the noon or the evening meal. However, the term "dinner" can have
        many different meanings depending on the culture;
